# Liverpool FC web project - README
## liverpool-fc-web-project
Liverpool FC website project produced as part of University of Edinburgh/ 
HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp. The website contains two standalone 
pages ('Home' and 'Honours'), a members' area which makes use of a custom
Django user/ authentication solution and a competition area which allows an
admin use to load competition 'posts' and makes use of Django authentication
routines.

DISCLAIMER: this is a personal project and is in no way affiliated with Liverpool
Football Club.  The development of this project is for personal use only, and
any demonstrations of features (e.g. competitions) are exemplars only.
